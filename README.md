# node-deep-extend

### Why another extend function when there are already so many on the internet? 

Because I couldn't find one that was doing what [extend](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extend) and [@sinclair/typebox (Value.Clone)](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox?tab=readme-ov-file#values-clone) are doing at the same time.

This code is basically [extend](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extend) rewritten to only deep extend and to also extend property symbols like [Value.Clone](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox?tab=readme-ov-file#values-clone) does for [@sinclair/typebox](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sinclair/typebox).

Thanks to those two awesome packages!
